## Eyal Ginosar

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Im Eyal Ginosar, M.Sc. in Data Science. On my GitHub page, you will find projects which were undertaken as part of my academic
courses in my Master's degree. There are documented implementation codes in Python, as well as summary reports for the projects. $$r^2$$

### Machine Learning:
1. [Recommendation model for bank direct marketing](https://github.com/eyal-gi/Bank-Marketing-Recommendation) - Classification with fully-supervised learning methods 
(e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) and dealing with imbalanced data.

### Computer Vision:
1. [Flowers classfication](https://github.com/eyal-gi/Flowers-Classification) - Binary classification of images using ResNet model.
2. [Plants disease classifier](https://github.com/eyal-gi/Plant-disease-classifier) - Multi-class classification of diseases in plant's leaves with DenseNet model.


### NLP:
1. [Tweeter Authorship classification](https://github.com/eyal-gi/Tweeter-Authorship-Classification) - Manual feature extraction and word embeddings 
with deep learning models.
2. [Part-of-Speech tagger](https://github.com/eyal-gi/POS-Tagger) - Implementation of a Hidden Markov model and an LSTM model.
